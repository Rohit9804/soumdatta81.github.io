        I have thought about it from a very long time and now I feel its time I should really make it public. The system is full trash. "The System" includes everything you can think of. Since I have particularly experienced and a part of one system I will talk about that here which is the Indian Education System.
        <br>
        The Indian Education System was setup by the British back in their days and it is doesn't teaches you stuff but instead is more designed to make you a slave. Yes, you become a slave under the system. You get trapped. The sole purpose of education according to me is training which makes you intelligent and a person who can ask questions, basically a person who can ask "Why" is an intelligent person  and can never be a slave for anyone. Sadly, The Indian Education System never trains you to ask questions.
        <br>
        First of all, a big FUCK YOU to the British out there for doing all the shitty stuff  in the past. Now, honestly the people here are dumb as fuck. Let's be honest, people are brainwashed. I spent my school days which sucked honestly because I was never the topper nor the failure. I was always in the mediocre section which was disgusting for me presonally and also was a trauma because I was being compared to all the other kids.

        “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” - Albert Einstein
        <br>
        This quote explains everything but here the all the brainwashed people thinks the same. Let's assume not_good_in_studies is a boolean value(which is by default true) so the people here think:
        <br>
        if (not_good_in_studies):
        <br>
            print("You are a failure")
        <br>
        Everyone, EVERYONE everyday made me feel how big of a failure I am which made me give up on everything. But, there was a voice inside of me which kept saying me "I DONT SUCK". If I am grateful for one thing is life it will be I always listened to my inner voice. I realised I am playing the wrong game. Also, all my experiences trained me a lot and I learned how to cut off the noise and focus on the my own ring very early in life.
        <br>
        This was a short story about me and how I escaped the system and living the best life possible. Now not everyone is me. How many people will fall in that trap and never come out? Let's assume I am the exception. Except me how many kids will actuaally escape the whole system? The probability is very low and that's my problem.
        The education system is run by dumbass shitty miserbale people who just have degree and a Dr before their name who gives zero support to their students, egoist, etc. They dont have a learning mindset and living in delusion with a fixed mindset and no growth since when dont' ask lol. 
        They never teach you taxes, how to open a business, etc why? because they want you to stay a slave forever just how the indians were for over 200+ years. Now, dont be crazy and go out changing the whole world. Fuck the world, everyone is fucked they are just hiding it better. Fuck world, you matter. You focus on yourself and escape it alone. Once you escape, just sit back and enjoy the show.
        <br>
        I just want you to know if you feel you suck no you dont suck. The system sucks. It's bullshit and TRASH. Now, accept that its trash and take your own repsonsibilty onto your own hands and keep moving forwards and ESCAPE THE MATRIX.

        I wrote everyhting because its my blog and I can post whatever I want and if you disagree I really dont care about you. I write because of myself and if you like the ideas you can connect with them if not just ignore and go move on. Healthy criticism is always entertained though. Anyways, I will leave you with this quote:
